This file lists issues found by Santiago on Jan 2019 as he was going through the code for Lan's paper.

=== reward_change_generate_cell_database.py ===
173: CASE 6 uses file in Lan's folder, not in common:
     '/home/languo/src/jaratest/lan/analysis_reward_change/calculate_reward_modulation_celldb.py'
     There is a copy in 'common', but the script still points to the one in Lan's folder.

=== reward_change_generate_cell_database.py ===
175: Lan run these things by executing the python script via subprocess.
     That's very weird. We should just run it within (not externally via shell python).

=== calculate_reward_modulation_celldb.py ===
85: File uses NEW_DATABASE_FOLDER. Instead it should use
    settings.DATABASE_PATH, figparams.STUDY_NAME
    
=== Save missing trials ===
It would be hard to save missing trials in the database, so I saved in the evlockedspikes files.

=== Some cells have missing trials evens after fix ===
This means that the query should use missingTrialsBehav:
goodQualCells = celldb.query("missingTrialsBehav==0 and keepAfterDupTest==1 and cellInTargetArea==1 and brainArea=='{}'".format(brainArea))

=== The data for some cells doesn't load ===
adap071_2017-09-18_1100.0_T6_c2
The file size does not match a integer number of records

=== calculate_reward_modulation_celldb.py ===
Lan used (line 282) spikeCountMat = spikesanalysis.spiketimes_to_spikecounts()
but then (line 298) used spikesanalysis.evaluate_modulation() which does the same thing.
However, to estimate things by block it's useful to have the spikeCountMat, so maybe
using evaluate_modulation() is redundant here.

=== calculate_reward_modulation_celldb.py ===
In line 204 Lan has code to estimate block sizes, but the behavior class has a method to do that.
loadbehavior.FlexCategBehaviorData.find_trials_each_block()




movementAveFrLeft_[0.0, 0.3]_removedsidein  is calculated by:
