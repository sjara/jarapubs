List of figs:
- Show laser responses of photoidentified cells
- Tuning of photoidentified inhibitory cell
- Different cells showing different contextual modulation

- Example cell being silenced by laser
- Contextual modulation as control compared to modulation when inhibitory cell shut down

- Plot showing animal's performance at task
- Change in psychometric curve during inactivation: one for pharma, one for opto.
- Change in peformance when silencing one cell type (excitatory?)
